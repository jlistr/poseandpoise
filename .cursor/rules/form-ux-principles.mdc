# Form UX Principles — STRICT ENFORCEMENT

When building forms for this project, you MUST follow these principles. Forms should feel effortless, not overwhelming.

## Core Philosophy

**Less is more.** Every field, label, and interaction must earn its place. If it doesn't directly help the user complete their goal, remove it.

## REQUIRED Principles

### 1. Minimize Required Fields

```
✅ GOOD: Ask only what's essential for the current step
❌ BAD: Collecting "nice to have" data upfront
```

- Only mark fields as required if the feature genuinely cannot work without them
- Defer optional data collection to later (progressive profiling)
- Use smart defaults and auto-detection where possible

### 2. One Primary Action Per Screen

```
✅ GOOD: Clear single CTA — "Continue", "Save", "Submit"
❌ BAD: Multiple competing buttons with equal visual weight
```

- Primary action should be visually dominant
- Secondary actions (Skip, Back) should be subdued
- Never present more than 2-3 actions at once

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

```
✅ GOOD: Show advanced options only when needed
❌ BAD: Displaying all possible fields at once
```

- Start with the essentials, reveal complexity gradually
- Use expandable sections for optional/advanced inputs
- Hide conditional fields until their trigger is activated

### 4. Inline Validation & Feedback

```
✅ GOOD: Validate on blur, show errors next to the field
❌ BAD: Validation only on submit, errors at top of form
```

- Provide immediate, contextual feedback
- Use positive reinforcement (checkmarks) not just error states
- Auto-format inputs where appropriate (phone numbers, dates)

### 5. Smart Defaults & Auto-Detection

```
✅ GOOD: Pre-fill location from IP, suggest username from name
❌ BAD: Making users type everything from scratch
```

- Auto-detect what you can (location, timezone, language)
- Suggest values based on context
- Allow easy override of auto-filled values

## AI Assistance Guidelines

### AI Should ASSIST, Not Dominate

```
✅ GOOD: "Generate bio" button user can click if they want help
❌ BAD: AI automatically writing content without user initiation

✅ GOOD: AI suggests; user confirms or edits
❌ BAD: AI decides; user must undo if they disagree
```

### AI Feature Placement

- AI features should be **optional enhancements**, not required steps
- Place AI buttons as secondary actions, not primary CTAs
- Always show what AI will do before it does it
- Provide clear "undo" or "regenerate" options

### AI Loading States

- Show clear progress indicators during AI operations
- Allow cancellation of long-running AI tasks
- Never block the entire form while AI processes

## Visual Hierarchy

### Field Grouping

```
✅ GOOD: Logical sections with clear visual separation
❌ BAD: A wall of ungrouped input fields
```

- Group related fields together
- Use whitespace generously between sections
- Limit to 3-5 fields visible at once when possible

### Labels & Placeholders

```
✅ GOOD: Clear label above field, helpful placeholder inside
❌ BAD: Placeholder as only label (disappears on focus)
```

- Labels should be persistent and visible
- Placeholders provide examples, not instructions
- Help text appears below field, not as tooltip

## Mobile-First Considerations

- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Single-column layouts for forms
- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, url)
- Avoid dropdowns when radio buttons work better

## FORBIDDEN Patterns

- ❌ More than 7 fields visible at once without scrolling
- ❌ Required fields without clear indication
- ❌ Form submission without any validation feedback
- ❌ AI that auto-submits or auto-advances without user consent
- ❌ Disabled submit buttons without explanation why
- ❌ Unclear error messages ("Invalid input" without specifics)
- ❌ Forcing users through AI features to complete basic tasks

## ENFORCEMENT

Before building any form:
1. List the absolute minimum fields needed — can any be deferred?
2. Define one clear primary action per step
3. Plan progressive disclosure for optional/advanced fields
4. Ensure AI features are opt-in enhancements, not blockers
5. Test the form can be completed without using any AI features
